## did-dpki 

### A did method to verify identity and residence using pluggable authentication sources


#### Why did-dpki

PAID Smart Agreements need verifiable proof of identity to work well with legal contracts. Legal contracts, because they are binding, need a way
to ensure all parties are accountable under a jurisdiction. In a simple legal agreement workflow, a KYC solution might be enough. But considering PAID
 is a decentralized based protocol, using smart contracts and oracles, we'll need a good set of technology stack that supports enough data sources and still
 keep the level of decentralization required.
 
 #### Proposal
 
 `did-dpki` uses DID Method specification as standard to be able to integrate with other DID applications and services in the ecosystem. Based from ideas found in
 `did-ethr`, we will have the following:
 
 - `delegate`: be able to delegate to another did user
 - `add`: register public key 
 - `revoke`: unregister public key
 
 It must be resolvable, that is, be able to lookup and match by its public key.
 
 Additionally, did-dpki needs to have a decentralized KYC experience, it must be able to do:
 
 - `As a user, provision a signed well known document and publish it to IPFS / IPNS`
 - `As a user, approve or reject Certificate Authority keypair issuing`
 - `As a validator, validate did-dpki belongs to DNS`
 - `As a validator, validate DNS belongs to a did-dpki`
 
 Ideally, but optional, provisioning must permit users to configure a `verified domain name` under paidnetwork or similar DNS name, similar to `domain.kreds`. Eg we could have a party sign a smart agreement with a domain name `alice-wonderland.paid.network` and the other party signing with `bob-realworld.paid.network`.
 
 To implement this use case requires several pieces of technology:
 
 #### P384 or secp256r1

 > Sobre lo dos estandar se que el primero el P-384 es por un tema de firmas digitales pero a nivel del manejo de las Keys pairs, Polka DOT, hace uso de estándar ed25519 y no del secp256k1, y esto tiene una justificación documentada aquí:
 > - [Why was ed25519 selected over secp256k1?](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-keys#why-was-ed25519-selected-over-secp256k1)
 > - [Appendix A: On the security of curves](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-keys#appendix-a-on-the-security-of-curves)
 
 We need to sign the wellknown document using a keypair using ECDSA NIST P384. This to be compatible with the Certificate Authority and Smart Contracts requiring to verify these signatures.
 
 #### IPNS
 
 Once the document is pushed to IPFS, create and publish to IPNS and optionally, use DNSLink to link to a human readable DNS name.
 
 #### Certificate Authority
 
 There are two different implementations here:
 
 - `Use of centralized CAs`: [Use Let's Encrypt with ECDSA Support](https://letsencrypt.org/certificates/)
 - `Use of PAID Network Decentralized CA nodes`: Using a combination of Smart Contracts and or a LB of CAs nodes
 
 #### Option 1 - Let's Encrypt
 
 Using the IPNS wellknown, provision ECDSA keypair and store in PAID wallet. These keypair will be used for Domain Name proof of identity.
 
 #### Option 2 - Smart Contract
 
 A Smart Contract in Polkadot can issue ECDSA keypairs. And either using EVM or Polkadot, be able to verify ECDSA keypairs onchain.

 > Para este punto, ya PolkaDOT maneja dos plataformas de desarollo:
 > - [Edgeware](https://docs.edgewa.re/) `Ethereum WebAssembly (Ewasm)`
 > - [!ink](https://substrate.dev/substrate-contracts-workshop/#/) `ink! is an eDSL to write WebAssembly based smart contracts using the Rust programming language`
 
 #### Proof of Address
 
 Using an existing KYC provider Proof of Address service, create a Chainlink oracle that handles any KYC related actions. In this special case, because of cost, any proof of address validation must be accounted in the transaction and billed depending on token being used.

### Previous Work

- **XDV Technology**: Contains components to create digital signatures for documents using HD Wallet technology and integrates with Swarm (ethereum) and compatible with hardware modules that support PKCS#11 and PKCS#12. Links: https://app.xdv.digital/about/#/ (Spanish), https://app.xdv.digital/
- **MDV**: A Solidity state  machine and workflow engine, using optimized code with RLP encoding. Links: https://gist.github.com/molekilla/b85f1c9de63be3afacbfeca703bb3fe4 (Spanish)


### Ecosystem Fit 

- **OpenLaw**: Smart contract based legal agreements. Links: https://www.openlaw.io/

Our project is different in that our team has had more than a year of experience with making wallets for blockchain dapps and then half a year with deep experience in DID, Swarm, IPFS and document signing, which are the bulk of tech experience as defined in OpenLaw. But our protocol takes it a bit further and uses oracles and ML to make it more automated and allows for hybrid scenarios, where a ML business logic can rank or tag a dispute and then it can be further review by an incentivized human arbitror, allowing for consensus of a dispute. Compared to OpenLaw, which is OpenCourt API is strictly human based, our protocol excels not only in the dispute/arbitrage, but also at transcribing using NLP instead of a Markup Language.

Further along, by adding the latest in identity technology, allows us to delegate authority to smart contracts using the DID decentralized identity of the individual or smart contract.

We think this project, while developed in EVM, will allow for better and transparent DeFi projects to be used in the Polkadot ecosystem.

 ### Summary
 
 By maintaining developer efficient processes, putting Proof of Identity and Proof of Address allows our smart agreements protocol, to have near identitical set of requirements as those found in a KYC solution. At the same time, it doesn't disrupt the CA business, it expands the CA and digital signing for vendors. In future protocol upgrades, an incentivization model could be added to make eg a reputation voting system, to be able to have another layer of trust.

## 7. Network topology

The figure below illustrates the three primary components of a Sidetree-based DID overlay network:

1. The underlying ledger system that serves as the global anchoring and linear sequencing system for DID operations.
2. The Sidetree nodes themselves, which interact with the ledger system to anchor operations, fetch and replicate data from the CAS network, and process operations in accordance with the protocol deterministic ruleset.
3. An integrated Content-Addressable Storage (CAS) network layer Sidetree nodes use to distribute and replicate DID operation files.

## 8. File Structures

The protocol defines the following three file structures, which house DID operation data and are designed to support key functionality to enable light node configurations, minimize permanently retained data, and ensure performant resolution of DIDs.
